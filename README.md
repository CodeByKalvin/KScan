### Introduction

KScan is a command-line tool designed to detect keyloggers on Windows systems. It scans for suspicious processes, keyboard hooks, files, and registry entries that are commonly associated with keylogging activity. This tool is intended for users who want to enhance their system security by detecting potential threats.

---

### Features

*   **Process Monitoring:** Lists running processes and checks for suspicious names, paths, and command-line arguments.
*   **Hook Detection:** Detects low-level keyboard hooks to identify keylogging.
*   **File System Scanning:** Checks common startup locations for suspicious files and content.
*   **Registry Analysis:** Scans the Windows registry for keys and values often used by keyloggers.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Uses an external JSON file, making it easier to update configurations.
*   **Clear Output:** Presents analysis results with a summary of suspicious findings.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes try-except blocks to catch errors, log them, and prevent application crashes.
*  **Modularity:** The code is structured into classes, to make it easier to maintain and to add new functionalities.
*  **Platform Specific:** Only works on Windows systems.

### Installation

To use KScan locally, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
cd [repository_directory]
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.6 or higher** installed. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` should contain the following:
```txt
psutil
pywin32
```

---

### Usage

Once installed, you can run the application from the command line using:

```bash
python keylogger_detector.py
```

#### Configuration

1. **Create Config File**: To create the initial configuration file run the app using the `-c` flag:
    ```bash
    python keylogger_detector.py -c
    ```
    This will generate the `detector_config.json` file.
2.  **Edit Configuration:** The behavior of the application is controlled by the `detector_config.json` file. You can specify:
    *   `suspicious_process_names`: A list of suspicious process names.
    *   `suspicious_process_paths`: A list of suspicious process paths.
    *   `suspicious_file_names`: A list of suspicious file names.
    * `suspicious_file_locations`: A list of folders to be scanned.
    *   `suspicious_registry_keys`: A list of suspicious registry keys to be scanned.

#### Starting Keylogger Scan

To start the keylogger scan:

```bash
python keylogger_detector.py -s
```

The tool will output the analysis results, with a summary of the suspicious findings.
